    # output field called "output", these values will be passed to the
    # "postprocess" job.  Because these values are not ready until the
    # "process" jobs finish, the "postprocess" job WILL NOT RUN until
    # all job-based object references have been resolved (i.e. the
    # jobs they reference have finished running).
    #
    # If you do not plan to have the "process" jobs create output that
    # the "postprocess" job will require, then you can explicitly list
    # the dependencies to wait for those jobs to finish by setting the
    # "depends_on" field to the list of subjobs to wait for (it
    # accepts either dxpy handlers or string IDs in the list).  We've
    # included this parameter in the line below as well for

    # job-based object references in the input that refer to the same
    # set of jobs.

    # can change that behavior to suit your needs.

    # on here as follows:
    #
    # return { "app_output_field": postprocess_job.get_output_ref("answer"), ...}
    #
    # Tip: you can include in your output at this point any open
    # objects (such as gtables) which will be closed by a job that
    # finishes later.  The system will check to make sure that the
    # output object is closed and will attempt to clone it out as
    # output into the parent container only after all subjobs have
    # finished.
